# ActiveAgenda
## Final project for Emmett Witchel's CS 371M Mobile Computing class. 

ActiveAgenda is a planner app that lets the user create new tasks and view tasks by day, week, or specific tag (ie, all tasks related to biology homework). All tasks with the same tag are color-coded, and tags can be managed in a special menu option.
